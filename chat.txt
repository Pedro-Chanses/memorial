-----> Determining which buildpack to use for this app
-----> Python app detected
-----> Using Python 3.9.18 specified in runtime.txt
 !     Warning: The runtime.txt file is deprecated.
 !     
 !     The runtime.txt file is deprecated since it has been replaced
 !     by the more widely supported .python-version file:
 !     https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/3141
 !     
 !     Please delete your runtime.txt file and create a new file named:
 !     .python-version
 !     
 !     Make sure to include the '.' at the start of the filename.
 !     
 !     In the new file, specify your app's Python version without
 !     quotes or a 'python-' prefix. For example:
 !     3.9
 !     
 !     We strongly recommend that you use the major version form
 !     instead of pinning to an exact version, since it will allow
 !     your app to receive Python security updates.
 !     
 !     In the future support for runtime.txt will be removed and
 !     this warning will be made an error.
 !     Warning: Support for Python 3.9 is ending soon!
 !     
 !     Python 3.9 will reach its upstream end-of-life in October 2025,
 !     at which point it will no longer receive security updates:
 !     https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions
 !     
 !     As such, support for Python 3.9 will be removed from this
 !     buildpack on 7th January 2026.
 !     
 !     Upgrade to a newer Python version as soon as possible, by
 !     changing the version in your runtime.txt file.
 !     
 !     For more information, see:
 !     https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-python-versions
 !     Warning: A Python patch update is available!
 !     
 !     Your app is using Python 3.9.18, however, there is a newer
 !     patch release of Python 3.9 available: 3.9.22
 !     
 !     It is important to always use the latest patch version of
 !     Python to keep your app secure.
 !     
 !     Update your runtime.txt file to use the new version.
 !     
 !     We strongly recommend that you do not pin your app to an
 !     exact Python version such as 3.9.18, and instead only specify
 !     the major Python version of 3.9 in your runtime.txt file.
 !     This will allow your app to receive the latest available Python
 !     patch version automatically and prevent this warning.
